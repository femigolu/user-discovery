                      MIMI Discovery Requirements
            draft-interop-mimi-discovery-requirements-latest

Abstract

   This document defines requirements for the discovery problem within
   the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group.
   Discovery is essential for interoperability, allowing message senders
   to locate recipients across diverse platforms using globally unique,
   cross-service identifiers (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
   The core challenge involves reliably mapping these identifiers to
   messaging service providers and determining the reachability of a
   recipient's identifier across multiple providers.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Glossary of terms:

   1.  A *Service Specific Identifier (SSI)* is a unique identifier for
       a user within the context of a single messaging service provider.
       It is not globally unique across services.  A fully-qualified SSI
       includes the messaging service provider's unique identifier,
       making it globally unique.  Note that existence of an unqualified
       SSI on two or more services does not guarantee that the
       associated accounts belong to the same user.  Thus, linking SSIs
       across services requires other verified data to establish a
       match.  An example of a service specific identifier is a user's
       X/Twitter handle.

   2.  A *Cross-Service Identifier (CSI)* is a globally unique
       identifier for a user that can be used to identify the user
       across multiple services.  For example, a user's E.164 phone
       number, email address, or other service independent identifiers
       are CSIs, since they can be used to identify the user across
       multiple different services.

   3.  A *Messaging Service Provider (MSP)* provides messaging, voice,
       video and other forms of real-time communications services to end
       users.  Examples of messaging service providers are WhatsApp,
       Messages, iMessage, Wire, Matrix, Signal etc.  A user is
       reachable using one or more CSIs and may have at least one SSI
       internal to the MSP platform.

   4.  A *Cross-Service Identifier Provider (CSIP)* is an entity that
       issues, manages, and verifies CSIs.  Examples are traditional
       telecom providers, email providers, and other platforms capable
       of issuing user-controlled identifiers.

   5.  A *Discovery Provider (DP)* is an entity that facilitates the
       discovery reachability as outlined in this requirements document.
       This involves creating, managing, and leveraging authoritative
       mappings of CSIs to the MSPs where users can be reached.  We
       expect that a DP may be operated by or affiliated with an MSP or
       a third party.

2.  Introduction

   MIMI discovery seeks to enable users to easily connect and
   communicate across different messaging platforms, even if they don't
   know which specific platform the other person uses.  Currently, users
   often need to ask contacts what service they are on out-of-band, or
   try multiple services, which creates friction.  Specifically,
   discovery helps a user on one messaging service (Alice on Service A)
   to find another user on a potentially different or same service (Bob
   on Service B) in a provider-neutral manner.

   Discovery is necessary because the identifiers we commonly have for
   contacts (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) do not necessarily
   tell us which messaging service they are using.  Someone with the
   email alice@gmail.com might use iMessage, Signal, or another service
   entirely.  Thus, the core problem is how to take one of these cross-
   service identifiers and learn the messaging service provider that the
   user is using, and how to communicate with them on that service.

2.1.  Problem Statement

   The discovery problem involves:

   1.  Asserting verifiable mappings between CSIs and MSPs, and

   2.  Looking up mappings to determine MSPs for which a CSI can be
       reached for messaging.

   Discovered mappings must be verifiable to ensure they are accurate.
   Crucially, discovery must prioritize user privacy, allowing users to
   control their discoverability, and it must integrate well with end-
   to-end encryption and other MIMI protocols.

   Note that mapping lookup is distinct from the retrieval of the user's
   SSI and cryptographic keys.  Retrieval of the SSI and keys typically
   occurs as part of the messaging process and can easily be done after
   the MSP for the message recipient has been located through discovery.
   For example, an MSP might store a mapping of CSIs to SSIs and
   cryptographic keys.  The client would then retrieve this data just
   before Alice sends a message to Bob, following the successful
   discovery that Bob is reachable through the MSP.

   The rest of this document describes a series of requirements for the
   discovery problem.

3.  Prior Efforts

   Discovery services are far from new on the Internet.  The whois
   protocol [RFC3912], largely focused on mapping domain names to
   associated services.  It was one of the earliest discovery services
   deployed on the Internet.  DNS SRV records, specified in [RFC2782],
   allow a similar process - given a domain name, a user can discover
   available services, such as VoIP based on the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] [RFC3263].  SRV records were adapted
   specifically for messaging in [RFC3861].  However, both whois and DNS
   SRV records rely on domain names as lookup keys, making them
   unsuitable for identifiers like mobile phone numbers, which don't
   have inherent domain associations.

   ENUM [RFC6117] addressed this limitation.  It used DNS to lookup
   phone numbers by reversing the digits and adding the "e164.arpa"
   suffix.  This allowed delegation of portions of the namespace to
   telco providers who owned specific number prefixes.  While
   technically straightforward, public deployment of ENUM was hampered
   by challenges in establishing authority for prefixes.  However,
   private ENUM [RFC6116] services have become relatively common,
   facilitating functions like MMS routing within messaging.

   Another attempt was ViPR (Verification Involving PSTN Reachability)
   [I-D.rosenberg-dispatch-vipr-overview] [I-D.petithuguenin-vipr-pvp].
   ViPR utilized a peer-to-peer network based on RELOAD (Resource
   Location and Discovery) [RFC6940] to operate between enterprises.  It
   addressed the authority problem by authorizing records based on proof
   of forward routability but faced the same network effects issue as
   ENUM.  ViPR attempted to address incentive problems by focusing on
   enterprises seeking cost savings by bypassing the phone network.
   Ultimately, network effects challenges (among other protocol-
   unrelated issues) prevented widespread deployment.

   Discovery and lookup services are now commonplace on the Internet but
   are largely scoped within large providers such as Facebook, Twitter,
   WhatsApp, and others.

   The MIMI discovery service requires a solution that spans providers.

4.  Architectural Models

   To ensure completeness and to address implementation considerations
   for MIMI DP, we present several potential architectural models.  The
   working group observed these requirements are similar among these
   models and opted to maintain architectural neutrality for the
   discovery protocol.  However, we will outline requirements for the
   roles of DPs, how they interact with each other, MSPs in a federated
   model, and how DPs accommodate queries from both MSPs and users.

4.1.  Centralized DP (Monolithic Service)

   A globally accessible, authoritative database (potentially sharded/
   replicated) stores all authenticated CSI mappings.  This monolithic
   service, implemented across synchronized global nodes, handles all
   CSI queries from messaging platforms and acts as the single source of
   truth for mapping data, even if certain mappings may be restricted in
   specific regions due to geopolitical considerations.

4.1.1.  Advantages

   *  Standardization and uniform control over mapping creation,
      updates, and data formats.

   *  Promotes fair and unbiased CSI mapping discovery.

   *  Single source of truth for mapping simplifies data management and
      ensures consistency.

   *  Sharding/replication can address geographical distribution and
      performance needs.

4.1.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Centralization of sensitive user data raises privacy risks.

   *  May conflict with data localization regulations.

   *  Single point of failure vulnerability from outages affecting the
      entire system.

   *  Potential difficulty with immediate global updates for rapidly
      changing mappings.

4.2.  Hierarchical DPs (Discovery Resolvers)

   A global root Discovery Provider (DP) directs mapping requests to
   authoritative DPs based on CSI structure (e.g., country codes for
   E.164 phone numbers) or sharding mechanisms.  The root DP, similar to
   hierarchical DNS, acts as a directory service, holding pointers to
   authoritative DPs rather than mappings themselves.  Alternatives to
   hierarchical resolution, like the LoST protocol [RFC5222], or
   distributed hash tables (DHTs), can achieve similar outcomes.

4.2.1.  Advantages

   *  Scalability from distributed load and mapping management across
      multiple DPs.

   *  Flexibility that allows different DPs to specialize in specific
      CSI ranges for regions.

   *  Better alignment with data localization requirements.

4.2.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Requires coordination and maintenance of hierarchy.

   *  Root DP failure could disrupt the entire system.

   *  Potential delays due to additional hops in the discovery process.

4.3.  Federated DPs (Distributed Peer Service)

   In a federated model, multiple independent DPs collaborate to provide
   CSI mapping discovery.  Each DP holds a subset of mappings and
   pointers to other DPs, with no central authority dictating mapping
   locations.  Discovering all mappings for a CSI may involve querying
   multiple DPs.  DPs can exchange CSI information or recursively query
   each other.  The specifics of DP federation are determined by
   business agreements, not technical requirements.  A variation of this
   model involves messaging platforms acting as their own DPs, managing
   mappings for their users.

4.3.1.  Advantages

   *  Decentralization ensures there is no single point of control or
      failure.  The system can continue functioning even if some DPs are
      unavailable.

   *  Mappings can be distributed according to local regulations.

4.3.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Discovery process may involve querying multiple DPs, increasing
      network load.

   *  Potential for bias as DPs may prioritize their own mappings,
      leading to uneven results.

   *  Requires robust mechanisms to prevent CSI impersonation and ensure
      trust between DPs.

   *  Pairwise relationships in a federated DP model could create a
      barrier to entry for smaller MSP/DPs, similar to the trust
      requirements in the DKIM [RFC6376] and DMARC [RFC8616] ecosystems.

4.4.  Additional Considerations on Architectural Models

4.4.1.  Telephone Number CSIs

   Telephone number portability is complex due to its reliance on real-
   time queries to proprietary and legacy systems.  Overall, the
   authenticated mappings proposed for MIMI may necessitate additional
   platform measures to assess mapping freshness and ensure up-to-date
   reachability responses.

4.4.2.  Bias Mitigation

   Bias occurs when a DP prioritizes mappings to its affiliated MSP
   without consideration of what is best for end users.  Mitigating bias
   is essential to ensure fair and equitable discovery of authenticated
   mappings across different services.  The working group has decided to
   defer such mitigation to policies and regulations, excluding it from
   the discovery protocol.

6.  Authenticating Mappings Requirements

   A Discovery Provider aggregates mappings between CSIs and platforms
   from trusted sources.  To prevent impersonation attacks where
   platforms or users simply claim to own a CSI, the user must solve a
   proof of possession challenge for the CSI before a DP can establish
   reachability mapping involving the CSI.  Suitable approaches include
   SMS one-time-code or voice call verification to prove possession of
   phone number, email link verification for emails, OAuth sign-in for
   Twitter and YouTube identifiers.  A potential architecture for
   generating credentials from proof-of-possession checks is shown in
   [I-D.draft-peterson-mimi-idprover].  A platform performing discovery
   should be able to verify that the target user established the
   reachability mapping.  Note that once a mapping is created, it can be
   distributed by any DP, and it should include metadata for clients
   that receive it to verify its authenticity.

6.1.  Functional Requirements

   At least, a user's client, MSP, and DP MUST participate in a
   consensus protocol to establish a CSI-to-MSP mapping with the
   following requirements:

   1.  The DP MUST verify the user's possession of the CSI through some
       proof-of-possession challenge.

   2.  The MSP MUST confirm that the CSI is reachable on its service.

   3.  The client, MSP, and DP must collaborate to generate a verifiable
       representation of the CSI-to-MSP mapping (e.g., using a threshold
       signature).  The can then be shared with any DP and verifiable by
       clients.

6.2.  Privacy and Security Requirements

   1.  A DP MUST NOT be able to create a verifiable mapping without the
       involvement of the user holding the CSI and MSP.

   2.  The DP MUST NOT be able to falsely claim that a user completed
       the proof-of-possession challenge.

   3.  Other users MUST be able to verify that the CSI holder (and not
       an imposter) participated in creating the mapping.

7.  Preferences

   The discovery process involves the preferences of multiple
   stakeholders:

   1.  the querier seeking reachability information,

   2.  the user with the mapped identity, and

   3.  DPs (and by extension, the collaborating MSPs).

   The authors suggest the following:

   *  Implementations shouldn't dictate a one-size-fits-all approach for
      expressing and meeting these preferences, but should rather
      implement basic building blocks for each of these parties to
      express their preferences.

   *  DPs should clearly communicate their preference handling practices
      to promote transparency and trust.

   *  The discovery requirements consider detailed preferences and
      capabilities out of scope, leaving them to individual
      implementations.

   *  Given that the sender initiates discovery requests and already has
      options on which app, MSP, and DP to query, we will only provide a
      basic recipient preference specification as a requirement below.

7.1.  Basic Recipient's Preference Requirement

   Requirement: Authenticated mappings MUST include a preference tag to
   enable recipients to control their preferred contact mapping.

   The preference tag can be either a string (e.g., "Business",
   "Personal", "BasketballFriends", "WhatsApp") or a list of strings
   (e.g., "Business, WhatsApp").  For example, a recipient might want
   senders from WhatsApp to utilize a specific non-default "WhatsApp"
   mapping.

   1.  The default mapping must be designated as "Default" and cannot be
       a list.

   2.  Non-default mappings can have one or more tags to signify the
       recipient's intended purpose for that contact mapping.

   3.  The total length of tags should be limited within the protocol.

   4.  If a CSI's set of mappings lacks a default mapping or multiple
       mappings have the "Default" tag, the recipient can choose any of
       the mappings for communication.

   5.  Tie-breaking should occur only once and be re-evaluated solely
       through explicit user action.  This prevents messages from a
       sender from being scattered across multiple mappings for the
       recipient.

7.2.  Recipient's Critical User Journeys (implementations)

   Here are some Critical User Journeys (CUJs) that are the most
   important to discovery recipients.

   In the CUJs below, Bob is the recipient, and Alice is the sender or
   user performing discovery:

   1.  Sender mapping preferences: Bob only wants to be found by Alice
       and other users on WhatsApp, not his other messaging apps.

   2.  Same-app preferences: Bob prefers that Alice can find him on the
       same messaging service that she is using.  In other words, Bob
       does not want cross-app discovery and messaging.

   3.  No-random mapping preferences: Bob does not want to go through
       multiple apps to find a message from Alice when discovery returns
       one of 10 mappings that Bob has established with discovery
       providers.

   4.  No-duplication preferences: Bob does not want Alice's messages to
       be broadcasted to all or a subset of his apps based on the result
       of discovery.

   5.  Per-sender preferences: Bob wants to control which app messages
       from Alice go to and do the same for other users (e.g., Carol's
       messages may go to a different app than Alice's).

   6.  Closed group preferences: Bob only wants his soccer parents to
       discover and contact him on WhatsApp, not his Wire app.  That is,
       a group of senders has the same mapping results based on Bob's
       preferences.

   7.  Open-ended group preferences: Bob wants his business contacts to
       discover and reach him on Wire, not WhatsApp.  That is, an open-
       ended list of senders (i.e., including leads) are provided with a
       designated mapping.

8.  Discovery Protocol Requirements

8.1.  Identifier Types

   Discovery MUST support any globally unique cross-service identifier
   with the following characteristics:

   1.  Backing source of truth: Authoritative issuing entities exist for
       issuing the CSI to users (e.g., CSIP for telephone numbers).

   2.  Ownership proof mechanism: The user issued a CSI must be able to
       demonstrate or pass a proof of possession challenge from a remote
       prover.

   3.  Versatility: CSIs must be deployable and usable across multiple
       services

   Phone numbers and email addresses are examples of suitable and
   supported identifiers.

8.2.  Discovery Response Requirements

8.2.1.  Cardinalities

   The discovery protocol must accommodate scenarios with varying
   numbers of MSPs in the discovery results:

   1.  Zero MSPs: The system should indicate a no-match condition if
       users and their associated Identifiers (e.g., CSIs) are not
       discoverable on any MSP.  This enables the originating user to
       recognize that the CSI is not reachable via the discovery system.

   2.  One MSP: The system should function efficiently when a CSI is
       associated with a single MSP.

   3.  Multiple MSPs: The system should accommodate users with multiple
       MSPs.

8.2.2.  Response format

   An MSP or client app may request responses that are verbose or
   compact.  A verbose response may include all unique lists of mappings
   discovered with metadata for the client to verify each mapping, and
   metadata about the list or count of DPs where that mapping was found.
   A compact response may be as simple as a bit string with each set bit
   representing that the CSI is found in the MSP assigned to that bit
   position.  The protocol MUST define specific formats for both
   response types.

8.3.  Discovery Request Requirement

8.3.1.  Requests

   Discovery requests must include the CSI and may include additional
   query parameters to guide the search process.  The query parameters
   below MUST be supported.

8.3.1.1.  Federation

   Indicate if the DP should answer queries using its own database or
   federate the request to other DPs and aggregate their answers in a
   fair and transparent manner.  In a federated model, a DP that chooses
   not to federate may be limited in the queries it can answer.
   Certainly, a DP can incorporate mappings that either reference
   another DP's mapping or materialize those mappings into its own local
   database.

8.3.1.2.  MSP filter

   Useful for scoping the response of interest to one or more MSPs
   (e.g., query for CSI mapping to WhatsApp only).

8.3.1.3.  DP list

   A list of DPs may accompany each query to guide a DP on query
   federation decisions.  These sub-options for DP list must be
   supported:

   *  DP-preferred federation: signals for the DP to forward the query
      to its preferred subset of DPs.

   *  Client-selected federation: instructs the DP to forward the query
      to a specific list of DPs provided by the client.

   *  All DPs: mandates the DP to forward the query to all DPs within
      the ecosystem, utilizing a publicly accessible registry (described
      below).

8.3.2.  Default behavior disclosure

   A DP must externally disclose its default behavior which should be
   consistent with local regulatory requirements (e.g., do not federate
   by default for performance, privacy or regulatory reasons).  For
   example, in the absence of a context parameter, the DP disclosed it
   will utilize its local database to fulfill requests.

   A DP must follow some preferred default behavior that is agreed at
   the federation level.

8.3.3.  Client rate limit

   Again, forking discovery requests consume ecosystem resources, and
   could facilitate attacks.  Hence a DP may rate-limit non-default
   queries.  Specifically, a client may be limited to a few queries
   daily when federated to the entire ecosystem DPs.

8.3.4.  Server rate limit

   DPs may optionally rate-limit requests directed at DP endpoints with
   low query processing throughput for discovery responsiveness.

8.3.5.  Rate-limiting context

   A DP must provide sufficient context to the federation of DPs on a
   fork tree to assist them in rate-limiting requests from specific
   clients in a privacy-friendly manner.

8.4.  Privacy Requirements

8.4.1.  Requirement

   A DP must protect at least one end of the social graph during a
   request.  In other words, the DP must protect either the querier's
   identity or the CSI of interest in requests.

   Possible implementation approaches when Alice is discovering Bob's
   reachability:

   1.  Querier identity protection: IP blinding (e.g., Private Relay)
       can help to conceal Alice's identity or IP address so the DP may
       learn the query target only.

   2.  Query content protection: Techniques like Private Information
       Retrieval (PIR) or Private Set Membership (PSM) can conceal the
       target CSI, so the DP may learn the querier only.

   The messaging social graph of a user shows all the other users that
   the user has communicated with over time.The discovery social graph
   of a user shows all the users for whom discovery has been attempted.
   The discovery social graph is significantly larger than the messaging
   social graph, even though there may be some overlap between the two.
   To clarify, a user's address book defines their potential social
   network.  MIMI discovery, when applied comprehensively using the
   address book, reveals that network on various services.  In contrast,
   the messaging social graph only includes contacts actively messaged
   within a specific period, which is inherently a subset of the user's
   wider contact network.  Since discovery can query for users the
   initiator hasn't yet messaged, the discovery social graph is
   naturally larger.

9.  Operational Requirements

   The discovery service must support a decentralized architecture with
   multiple DPs, enabling federation based on user preferences,
   geopolitical boundaries, and DP-specific policies.

   Some additional considerations:

   1.  Federation mechanisms: Protocols or standards for DPs to
       communicate and exchange mapping data must be defined.  This
       includes how requests are routed and how DPs locate potentially
       relevant mappings stored elsewhere.

   2.  Data sovereignty: Regulations such as GDPR have a direct impact
       on where user data can reside.  Solutions must be designed to
       respect data locality and follow jurisdictional laws.

9.1.  Registry

   It is likely that reachability mappings on some services will not be
   shared publicly for privacy reasons.  Thus DPs may federate: for
   example, a discovery client may send a request to one DP, which will
   then need to consult a second DP in order to complete the request.
   Some sort of policies will need to govern the relationships between
   DPs and the terms under which they federate.  Such a policy is
   outside MIMI's purview.

   Metadata and service configurations about federation membership of
   interoperable DPs may be hosted on a registry managed by the
   federation.  Each DP's record may include a unique identifier,
   discovery endpoints, and other configuration metadata.

9.2.  CSI Release Timeliness

   The discovery service must strive to remove outdated mappings
   (resulting from users ending service with a CSIP) within a reasonable
   timeframe, but this timeframe must acknowledge the limitations of
   existing legacy systems and the potential for identifier reuse.  For
   example, in scenarios where a number is disconnected and later
   reassigned, the new user must designate the very first mapping as
   such.  This triggers the DP to broadcast invalidation requests to
   other DPs, effectively clearing any lingering mappings associated
   with the reassigned number.

9.2.1.  Mapping Prioritization Requirement

   Whenever a new mapping is attempted for an existing CSI, the one
   established earlier should generally take precedence.  This
   precedence SHOULD be overridden ONLY in the following cases:

   1.  The original CSI holder explicitly signals the mapping is no
       longer valid.

   2.  A new user of the CSI establishes a mapping and successfully
       completes a stricter proof of possession verification process.

9.2.2.  Conflict Resolution Protocol Requirement

   1.  DPs MUST implement a conflict resolution protocol when a new
       mapping creation attempt is made for a CSI that already has
       mappings within the DP's service.

   2.  This protocol SHOULD include a privacy-preserving notification to
       the holder of any existing mappings (without revealing the new
       user's identity).

   3.  If the conflict cannot be automatically resolved, the DP MAY
       escalate to a manual review process that involves additional
       verification steps for the new user.

9.2.3.  Invalidate Capability Requirement

   1.  Mechanisms SHOULD be provided to enable users to signal that a
       CSI they previously used is no longer under their control.  This
       could include:

       *  Collaborations with CSIP to receive re-assignment
          notifications.

       *  User-initiated invalidation requests.

   2.  Invalidate signals SHOULD trigger updates to discovery mappings
       to minimize conflicts.

9.3.  CSI Claim Timeliness

   Upon a user obtaining service for a new CSI (e.g., phone number or
   email address) from a CSIP, the discovery service must enable
   immediate discoverability when the user associates the CSI with a
   MSP.  The MSP MUST implement a mechanism to validate the user's
   control over the claimed CSI (as usual).

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Blackhole Prevention

   The discovery service must be designed to prevent malicious MSPs from
   falsely claiming association with a CSI to prevent messages intended
   for the legitimate user from being delivered.  This includes:

   *  Preventing message interception: Malicious MSPs MUST NOT be able
      to redirect messages by associating themselves with a CSI they do
      not control.

   *  Ensuring accurate discoverability: Malicious MSPs MUST NOT be able
      to make a non-user appear discoverable, leading to misdirected
      messages or false impressions of service adoption.

10.2.  DDoS, Enumeration and Spam Prevention and Mitigation

   The discovery service MUST put in place robust mechanisms to prevent
   and mitigate DDoS, large-scale CSI scraping and spamming by malicious
   providers (MSPs, DPs).  This requirement includes:

   *  Anti-DDoS, anti-enumeration and anti-spam defenses: The system
      design must effectively thwart attempts to DDoS attack, enumerate
      CSIs (especially phone numbers), and prevent the creation of spam
      target lists.  Techniques may include restrictions on bulk
      queries, obfuscation, or differential access levels based on MSP
      reputation and relationships.

   *  Flexible rate limiting: DPs must be able to enforce rate limits on
      discovery requests, with mechanisms to determine appropriate
      limits based on individual MSP behavior, business relationships,
      and potential risks.

10.3.  Encryption and Authentication

   All information exchanged between clients, DPs, and MSPs MUST be
   encrypted in transit and authenticated.

10.4.  Notes

11.  IANA Considerations
